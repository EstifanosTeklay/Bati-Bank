Bati Bank credit scoring model

Bati Bank, a leading financial service provider, is partnering with an eCommerce company to enable a buy-now-pay-later service. As an Analytics Engineer at Bati Bank, I have been tasked with developing a credit scoring model to evaluate the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. The model will use transaction data provided by the eCommerce platform to define a proxy variable for categorizing users as high-risk or low-risk, select relevant features that predict the default variable, and build models to assign risk probabilities, credit scores, and optimal loan amounts and durations. This project aims to create a robust and reliable credit scoring system to support Bati Bank's new buy-now-pay-later offering and ensure responsible lending practices.
